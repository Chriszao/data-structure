# Queues

The `queue`Â  data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first to be removed. A common analogy is a line of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and exit the queue at the other end (front/head).

Queue is abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

The queue has two main operations:

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the collection;
- Dequeue: Removes an element from the beginning of the collection;
