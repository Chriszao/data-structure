# Stack

Stacks are data structures that store elements in a sequential format, stacking one item on top of another (for example a stack of plates). These structures allow “stacking” the items that will be stored and “unstacking” these elements from the stack when we need to remove them. Whenever a new element is inserted (or stacked) we name it “top”, as it is the first element to which we will have access.

It follows a pattern known as LIFO (Last In First Out), where the last one in will be the first one out. Taking the example of the stack of plates, whenever a plate is “stacked” under another, this last plate stacked is the closest one (or the top of the stack) and, if it is necessary to remove a plate, it is the top plate that will be removed. removed from the structure.

An example of stack applications is the way the browser deals with visited sites, as we navigate between pages, the history of visited sites is allocated in a stack. When we want to go back to the last page visited, the browser takes the top page of the stack and redirects us to it.
